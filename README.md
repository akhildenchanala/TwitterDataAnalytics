# Twitter Data Analytics
This project is about mining Twitter data and discovering important features from it. Weâ€™ve developed a website and deployed it 
onto  server. The web page features with Trending Hashtags, Hashtags Trend - Flow, The author names of the Most Retweeted Tweets 
for a specific hashtag and the Tweet Distribution Map.

Twitter REST API was used to fetch the tweets based on the user provided query.
A web interface using Python-Flask Framework was built to show graphical plots on a dashboard.
Data analysis was performed using scikit-learn and pandas library.
Google charts was used plotting the graphs on the web dashboard.
